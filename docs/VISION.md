# 🔭 Product Vision: Aigents

## The Core Vision
To democratize the real estate market by providing every buyer and seller with an expert AI agent that is faster, more informed, and more accessible than traditional human-only services.

## Strategic Pillars
1. **AI-First Experience:** Every interaction is enhanced by GPT-4o, from generating listing copy to negotiating offers.
2. **Data Transparency:** Providing deep insights into on-market and off-market data that was previously locked behind agent-only paywalls.
3. **Frictionless Liquidity (The 1-Minute List):** Allowing sellers to list "off-market" by simply entering an address and answering 2-3 questions. We handle the content scraping and agent distribution.
4. **Offer Orchestration:** Handling the complexity of "Subject to Finance/B&P" offers to provide a clear "Cash-Equivalent" view for the seller.
5. **Hyper-Local Focus:** Mastering the Brisbane and Gold Coast markets before scaling nationally.
